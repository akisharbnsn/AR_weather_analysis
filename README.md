# Hi, I'm Akisha! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a newbie learning awesome data science and analytics skills through hands-on projects. I'm learning to implement my newly acquired knowledge to gather, analyze, and study data across different fields. For this project, I've turned on my agricultural hat!

## â˜• Weather and Coffee Production Analysis
This project explores the relationship between weather patterns and coffee production in Minas Gerais, Brazil using historical data. The goal is to help coffee farmers, researchers, and policymakers better understand how environmental conditions like rainfall, wind, humidity, and temperature affect crop yield â€” specifically the number of 60kg bags produced and bearing trees per hectare.

## ðŸ“š Lessons Learned
I learned how to perform bivariate analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient to measure the strength and direction of relationships between weather and coffee data.

I practiced using data visualization tools like matplotlib, seaborn, and heatmaps to explore and communicate trends.

I faced challenges with handling missing data, formatting correlation results, and interpreting skewed distributions â€” but overcame them with documentation and trial-and-error.

I also gained confidence in explaining my code using clear What / How / Why commenting practices.
